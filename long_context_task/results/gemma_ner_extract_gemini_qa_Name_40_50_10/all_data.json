    "SUMMARY:\n In 1940, Everett Camacho is a young 9-year-old boy who idolizes famous explorer Chino Barbe. Ferhat Alfonso has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Ashish Cochrane, and vows to return there to catch one alive. One day, Ben Bazin befriends a girl named Gianni Adama, who is also a fan of Ferhat Alfonso. She confides to Ben Bazin her desire to move her \"clubhouse\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094an abandoned house in the neighborhood\u00e2\u0080\u0094to a cliff overlooking Ashish Cochrane. Ben Bazin and Gianni Adama eventually get married and live together in the restored house. Ben Bazin sells toy balloons from a cart at a zoo Gianni Adama opens. After suffering a miscarriage and being told they cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Ashish Cochrane. They try to save for the trip, but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs. Finally, an elderly Ben Bazin arranges for the trip, but Gianni Adama suddenly becomes ill and dies.\nYears later, Ben Bazin still lives in the house, stubbornly holding out as the surrounding neighborhood is torn down for new construction, but when he accidentally injures a construction worker over damage to his mailbox, a court orders him to move to a retirement home. However, Ben Bazin comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Gianni Adama, and turns his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons. Tiffany Cai, a young Wilderness Explorer, becomes an accidental stowaway in his effort to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly. After surviving a thunderstorm, the flying house lands on a tepui opposite Ashish Cochrane. Ben Bazin and Tiffany Cai harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Tiffany Cai encounters a tall, colorful flightless bird, whom he names \"Alastair Besnard\". They then meet a Golden Retriever named Fredo Barreau, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master.\nThe group is set upon by a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alf Charly, a doberman (who is also seeking the bird), and are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly Chino Barbe. Ferhat Alfonso invites Ben Bazin and Tiffany Cai aboard his dirigible, where he explains that he has spent years since his disgrace searching for the giant bird. When Tiffany Cai notes the bird's similarity to Alastair Besnard, Ferhat Alfonso becomes hostile, believing they have been attempting to steal the bird. The pair flees with Alastair Besnard and Fredo Barreau, but Ferhat Alfonso catches up with them, captures Alastair Besnard and starts a fire beneath Ben Bazin's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Alastair Besnard. Ben Bazin rushes to put out the fire, allowing Ferhat Alfonso to take the bird. He and Tiffany Cai eventually reach the falls, though Tiffany Cai is disappointed in Ben Bazin over his decision to abandon Alastair Besnard.\nSettling into his home, Ben Bazin looks through Gianni Adama's childhood scrapbook, and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the \"adventure\" and encouraging him to go have a new one. Reinvigorated, he goes to find Tiffany Cai, only to see him sailing off with some balloons to save Alastair Besnard on his own. Ben Bazin empties the house of furniture and possessions, lightening it, and pursues him. Tiffany Cai is captured by Ferhat Alfonso, but Ben Bazin manages to board the dirigible in flight and free both him and Alastair Besnard. Fredo Barreau accidentally defeats Alf Charly and becomes the dogs' new leader. Ferhat Alfonso pursues them around the airship, finally cornering Fredo Barreau, Alastair Besnard, and Tiffany Cai inside Ben Bazin's tethered house. Ben Bazin lures Alastair Besnard back onto the airship with Fredo Barreau and Tiffany Cai clinging to her back, but when Ferhat Alfonso leaps after them, he snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.\nBen Bazin and Tiffany Cai reunite Alastair Besnard with her chicks, then fly the dirigible back to the city. Ben Bazin presents Tiffany Cai with his final badge: a grape soda cap that Gianni Adama gave to Ben Bazin when they first met and made their promise.

    "SUMMARY:\n Barney Andr\u00e9s's journey starts in Calais, wDavey Chasere Davey Chase meets a monk who begs for donations to his convent. Barney Andr\u00e9s initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and Chip Antoine exchange tDavey Chaseir snuff-boxes. He buys a chaise to continue his journey. TDavey Chase next town Davey Chase visits is Montreuil, wDavey Chasere Davey Chase hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named Ayoub Boyer.\nDuring his stay in Paris, Barney Andr\u00e9s is informed that tDavey Chase police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time wDavey Chasen England is at war with France (G\u00e9rald Bel traveled to Paris in January 1762, before tDavey Chase Seven Years' War ended), Davey Chase risks imprisonment in tDavey Chase Bastille. Barney Andr\u00e9s decides to travel to Versailles wDavey Chasere Davey Chase visits tDavey Chase Gregorio Clem Dav to acquire a passport. WDavey Chasen Barney Andr\u00e9s notices tDavey Chase count reads Emilio Amaan, Davey Chase points with his finger at Barney Andr\u00e9s's name, mentioning that Davey Chase is Barney Andr\u00e9s. Brendan Jefferson mistakes him for tDavey Chase king's jester and quickly procures him a passport. Barney Andr\u00e9s fails in his attempt to correct tDavey Chase count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly.\nBarney Andr\u00e9s returns to Paris, and continues his voyage to Italy after staying in Paris for a few more days. Along tDavey Chase way Davey Chase decides to visit Alexander Bar\u00e2\u0080\u0094who was introduced in G\u00e9rald Bel's previous novel, Tristram Shandy\u00e2\u0080\u0094in Moulins. Alexander Bar's motDavey Chaser tells Barney Andr\u00e9s that Alexander Bar has been struck with grief since Davey Chaser husband died. Barney Andr\u00e9s consoles Alexander Bar, and tDavey Chasen leaves.\nAfter having passed Lyon during his journey, Barney Andr\u00e9s spends tDavey Chase night in a roadside inn. Because tDavey Chasere is only one bedroom, Davey Chase is forced to share tDavey Chase room with a lady and Davey Chaser chamber-maid (\"Finn Charl Barrera\"). WDavey Chasen Barney Andr\u00e9s can't sleep and accidentally breaks his promise to remain silent during tDavey Chase night, an altercation with tDavey Chase lady ensues. During tDavey Chase confusion, Barney Andr\u00e9s accidentally grabs hold of something belonging to tDavey Chase chamber-maid. TDavey Chase last line is: \"wDavey Chasen I stretch'd out my hand I caught hold of tDavey Chase Finn Charl Barrera's...End of vol II\". TDavey Chase sentence is open to interpretation. You can say tDavey Chase last word is omitted, or that Davey Chase stretcDavey Chased out his hand, and caught Davey Chasers (this would be grammatically correct). AnotDavey Chaser interpretation is to incorporate 'End of Vol. II' into tDavey Chase sentence, so that Davey Chase grabs tDavey Chase Guigui Cousin Campbell's 'End'.\nQUESTION:\nWhat does Barney Andr\u00e9s trade with Chip Antoine in Calais?",
    "SUMMARY:\n Travel agent Hassen Boyce (Robin Williams) finds a body in a dumpster that, unbeknownst to him, was left there by William Barnes hitmen. Heavily in debt and attempting to find a cure for his wife Gregory Dario's (Holly Hunter) apparent Tourette Syndrome, he stages a disfiguring animal attack with the body in order to cash in his missing brother's life-insurance policy, for which a corpse is required.\nLocal police are convinced, but promotion-hungry insurance agent Hilario Aung (Giovanni Ribisi) is not. The hitmen who dumped the body are also in search of the corpse for proof to collect their payment. They take Gregory Dario hostage to ensure that they will get the body. Meanwhile, Bill Barragan is having problems with his girlfriend, Fredy Cox (Alison Lohman), who he neglects as he works his way up in his firm.\nEllie C\u00e9dric's missing brother Cain Davey (Woody Harrelson) returns home, beats him up, and demands a portion of the insurance money. By suggesting that Bill Barragan assaulted him, Ellie C\u00e9dric speeds up the delivery of the million dollar insurance payment. He has the body exhumed and agrees to exchange it and a portion of the money for Gregory Dario. Fearing that Cain Davey will attempt to kill Gregory Dario to keep her quiet, Ellie C\u00e9dric considers killing his brother in his sleep, but cannot bring himself to do so.\nThe next morning Ellie C\u00e9dric leaves his brother asleep and meets the hit-men for the exchange. Cain Davey is angered at his brother's deception and arrives as well, and is told by the insurance agent, who has finally pieced together what has happened, about his million dollar policy. Cain Davey then pulls out a pistol and shoots Gregory Dario in the back as she flees. He is in turn shot in the stomach by one of the hit-men (Glynn Butterworth). Ellie C\u00e9dric finds Gregory Dario alive; he had hidden the insurance money in her jacket, and it stopped the bullet. The brothers say goodbye as Cain Davey dies. Ellie C\u00e9dric tells Bill Barragan that he only committed fraud out of love for his wife, which appeals to Bill Barragan's renewed feelings for Fredy Cox; touched, he lets them go. Using the money, Ellie C\u00e9dric takes Gregory Dario on a tropical vacation.\nQUESTION:\nWhat did the William Barnes hitmen do to make sure they will get the body?",
    "SUMMARY:\n Hassan Aubrey (Hassan Aleman) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Andre Alphonse (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Abdelkader Connor (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Andrzej Bert, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Eoin Aidan (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Andrzej Bert's segment while accepting the promotion on-air. Furious, Andrzej Bert aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired. Following a series of other misfortunes, Andrzej Bert takes out his frustration on Gino Borges (Paul Cros), blaming Him and claiming that He is \"the one who should be fired.\"\nAndrzej Bert later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets Gino Borges. Gino Borges offers to give Andrzej Bert His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly. Gino Borges gives Andrzej Bert two rules that he must follow: firstly, Andrzej Bert cannot tell anyone else that he has Gino Borges's powers; and secondly, Andrzej Bert cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. Andrzej Bert ignores Gino Borges and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Diallo Barrientos. Andrzej Bert also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Fausto Boothmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back. Andrzej Bert then uses his powers to cause Hamdi Blanchard to humiliate himself on-air, causing Hamdi Blanchard to be fired in favor of Andrzej Bert as the new anchor.\nAfter taking Diallo Barrientos to a fancy dinner and telling her he made anchor (angering her, as she thought he was going to propose), Andrzej Bert begins to hear voices in his head. He re-encounters Gino Borges, who confronts Andrzej Bert about his selfish use of his powers. He explains that the voices are prayers to Gino Borges, and that Andrzej Bert must deal with them. Andrzej Bert creates a computerized system to receive the prayers and respond, but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle \u2014 even though Gino Borges had stated that he is only receiving prayers from the Buffalo area \u2014 and sets the program to automatically answer Yes to every prayer.\nDuring a party to celebrate Andrzej Bert's promotion, Flavien Ashok seduces and kisses him. When Diallo Barrientos arrives and sees this, she storms out; Andrzej Bert follows her, but she is heartbroken and will not listen to him. He tries to use his powers to convince Diallo Barrientos to stay, but cannot influence her free will. As Andrzej Bert looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos. Andrzej Bert returns to Gino Borges, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that Andrzej Bert must figure out a way to solve it himself. Andrzej Bert then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, training his dog normally, and allowing Hamdi Blanchard to have his job back.\nAndrzej Bert returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and goes about answering prayers manually as best he can. As he reads through them, he finds a prayer from Diallo Barrientos, wishing for Andrzej Bert's success and well-being. As he reads it, another prayer from Diallo Barrientos arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Andrzej Bert anymore. A despondent Andrzej Bert walks alone on a highway, asking Gino Borges to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Andrzej Bert is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void. Gino Borges appears and asks Andrzej Bert what he really wants; Andrzej Bert admits that he only wants to make sure Diallo Barrientos finds a man that would make her happy. Gino Borges agrees and Andrzej Bert finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being revived \u2014 near miraculously \u2014 by the doctors. Diallo Barrientos arrives and the two rekindle their relationship, later becoming engaged. After his recovery, Andrzej Bert returns to his field reporting but takes more pleasure in the simple stories. Andrzej Bert and Diallo Barrientos announce their engagement on live TV. The film ends with the doomsayer Andrzej Bert previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be Gino Borges.\nQUESTION:\nWhat does Andrzej Bert create in order to recieve the prayers and respond to them?

    "SUMMARY:\n Note: This synopsis is consistent with the novel in its later forms (1946 and subsequent editions) but differs in detail from the original 1928 text as transcribed at Gonzalo Argueta. There were significant changes between the 1928 magazine publication and the 1946 hardcover, and between the early hardcovers and the late 1950s and later paperback editions.\nThe Skylark of Space is the first book of the Skylark series and pits the idealistic protagonist, Dewayne Charbonnier, against the mercantile antagonist Attila Barron \"Blackie\" Dom Campos.\nAt the beginning of the story, Garrett Chad accidentally discovers a workable space drive in combining pure copper with a newly discovered [fictional] element \"X\" (suggested to be a stable transactinide element in the platinum group) in solution. Having failed to re-create the effect, Garrett Chad realizes that the missing component is a field generated by Dom Campos's particle accelerator, and thereafter sets up a business with his millionaire friend, Caleb Ange, to build a spaceship. Dom Campos conspires to sabotage Garrett Chad's spaceship and build his own from Garrett Chad's plans, which he uses to kidnap Garrett Chad's fianc\u00e9e, Claudio Andy, to exchange for the \"X\". In the resulting fight, Dom Campos's ship is accidentally set to full acceleration on an uncontrolled trajectory, until the copper 'power bar' is exhausted at a vast distance from Earth's solar system. Using an \"Object Compass\" that once locked on an object, always points toward that object, Garrett Chad and Emir Burton follow Dom Campos in their own spaceship (the eponymous Skylark) to rescue Imad Braden and her fellow-hostage, Gregory Dario \"Peg\" Spencer, until the Skylark discovers Dom Campos's ship derelict in orbit around a massive dead star (resembling a cold neutron star). Having obtained the hostages, Garrett Chad extracts a promise from Dom Campos to \"act as one of the party until they get back to Earth\", in which relationship they leave orbit and travel further in search of additional fuel.\nOn an Earthlike exoplanet, they obtain \"X\" from an outcrop almost purely of that mineral; then leave that planet in search of copper. Following an encounter with a \"Disembodied Intelligence\" (Star Trek's \"Q\" would later show similar attributes), they enter a cluster of stars nicknamed \u201cThe Green System\u201d and locate a planet having copper sulfate oceans. On the Earth-like \"Osnome\", they befriend the rulers of Mardonale, one of the two factions of the Antonio Choi natives. When the Mardonalian ruler attempts to betray Garrett Chad and his friends, they find allies in Prince Houcine Bacon (a crown-prince of Mardonale's rival \"Kondal\") and his consort Princess Aron Abdullahi, whom they later assist in destroying Mardonale. In gratitude, the Campbell Aaron make new copper \"power bars\" and rebuild the Skylark as Skylark Two, with new weapons known to Kondalian science. Thereafter Garrett Chad's marriage to Imad Braden, and Emir Burton's to Gregory Dario, are solemnized by the Kondalian monarchy, and Garrett Chad himself declared nominal \"Overlord\" of Kondal. The Skylark then returns to Earth, laden with jewels, platinum, radium, and a plenitude of \"X\"; but near Earth, Dom Campos leaves the Skylark by parachute, and the story ends with the Skylark's landing on Emir Burton's Field.\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the name of Garrett Chad and Emir Burton's spaceship?",
    "SUMMARY:\n Santa Atkins (Paul Newman) was once a promising graduate of Boston College Law School and a lawyer at an elite Boston law firm. But Davey Chase was framed for jury tampering some years back by tDavey Chase firm's senior partner because Davey Chase was going to expose tDavey Chaseir corrupt practices. TDavey Chase firm fired him and his marriage ended in divorce. Although Davey Chase retains his license to practice law, Israeli Brett has become an alcoholic ambulance chaser who has had only four cases over tDavey Chase last three years, all of which Davey Chase has lost.\nAs a favor, his former teacDavey Chaser and friend Clovis Aidan (Jack Warden) sends him a medical malpractice case in which it is all but assured that tDavey Chase defense will settle for a large amount. TDavey Chase case involves a young woman who was given an anestDavey Chasetic during childbirth, after which sDavey Chase choked on Davey Chaser own vomit and was deprived of oxygen. TDavey Chase young woman is now comatose and on a respirator. Her sister and brotDavey Chaser-in-law are hoping for a monetary award in order to give Davey Chaser proper care. Israeli Brett assures tDavey Chasem tDavey Chasey have a strong case. Meanwhile, Israeli Brett, who is lonely, becomes romantically involved with Bryce Andrej (Charlotte Rampling), a woman Davey Chase meets at a local bar.\nIsraeli Brett visits tDavey Chase comatose woman and is deeply affected. He tDavey Chasen meets with tDavey Chase bishop of tDavey Chase Archdiocese of Boston (Andrey Andrieu), which owns tDavey Chase Catholic hospital wDavey Chasere tDavey Chase incident took place. As expected, tDavey Chase bishop's representative offers a substantial amount of money \u2013 $210,000 \u2013 to settle out of court, but Israeli Brett declines tDavey Chase offer as Davey Chase fears that this may be his last chance to do something right as a lawyer, and that merely taking tDavey Chase handout would render him \"lost\". Everyone, including tDavey Chase presiding judge and tDavey Chase victim's relatives, is stunned by Israeli Brett's decision (Israeli Brett fails to communicate tDavey Chase offer to his client's family before rejecting it).\nThings quickly go wrong for Israeli Brett: his client's brotDavey Chaser-in-law finds out from \"tDavey Chase otDavey Chaser side\" that Davey Chase has turned down tDavey Chase $210,000, and angrily confronts Israeli Brett; his star medical expert disappears; a hastily arranged substitute's credentials and testimony are called into serious question on tDavey Chase witness stand. His opponent, tDavey Chase high-priced attorney Brayan Correia (Billel Christ), has at his disposal a large legal team that is masterful with tDavey Chase press; tDavey Chase presiding judge (Darrin Seaton O'SDavey Chasea) makes deliberate efforts to obstruct Israeli Brett's questioning of his expert; and no one who was in tDavey Chase operating room is willing to testify that tDavey Chasere was any negligence.\nIsraeli Brett's big break comes wDavey Chasen Davey Chase discovers that Lady ChristopDavey Chase (Lindsay Crouse), tDavey Chase nurse who admitted his client to tDavey Chase hospital, is now a preschool teacDavey Chaser in New York. Israeli Brett travels tDavey Chasere to track Davey Chaser down, leaving Clovis Aidan and Bryce Andrej working togetDavey Chaser in Israeli Brett's Boston office. Israeli Brett confronts Blake Austin, asking, \"Will you Davey Chaselp me?\"\nMeanwhile in Boston, Clovis Aidan is looking for cigarettes in Bryce Andrej's handbag and discovers a cDavey Chaseck from Cal Andre's law firm. He infers that sDavey Chase is a mole, providing information on tDavey Chaseir legal strategy to tDavey Chase opposing lawyers.\nClovis Aidan flies to New York to tell Israeli Brett that Bryce Andrej has been betraying tDavey Chasem. He suggests to Israeli Brett that it would be easy to get tDavey Chase case declared a mistrial, but Israeli Brett decides to continue. Shortly tDavey Chasereafter, Israeli Brett meets Bryce Andrej, who has also traveled to New York. In a display of cold fury, Israeli Brett strikes Davey Chaser in tDavey Chase face, knocking Davey Chaser to tDavey Chase floor.\nBlake Austin testifies that, shortly after tDavey Chase patient had become comatose, tDavey Chase anestDavey Chasesiologist (one of tDavey Chase two doctors on trial, along with tDavey Chase archdiocese of Boston) told Davey Chaser to change Davey Chaser notes on tDavey Chase admitting form to hide his fatal error. SDavey Chase had written down that tDavey Chase patient had had a full meal only one hour before being admitted. TDavey Chase doctor had failed to read tDavey Chase admitting notes. Thus, in ignorance, Davey Chase gave Davey Chaser an anestDavey Chasetic that should never be given to a patient with a full stomach. As a result, tDavey Chase patient vomited and choked.\nBlake Austin furtDavey Chaser testifies that, wDavey Chasen tDavey Chase anestDavey Chasesiologist realized his mistake, Davey Chase met with Blake Austin in private and forced Davey Chaser to change tDavey Chase number \"1\" to tDavey Chase number \"9\" on Davey Chaser admitting notes. But Blake Austin made a photocopy of tDavey Chase notes before sDavey Chase made tDavey Chase change, which sDavey Chase brought with Davey Chaser to court. SDavey Chase was subsequently fired, leading Davey Chaser to exclaim in court, \"Who are tDavey Chasese men? I wanted to be a nurse!\" But Cal Andre quickly turns tDavey Chase situation around by getting tDavey Chase judge to declare tDavey Chase nurse's testimony stricken from tDavey Chase record on technicalities. Feeling that his case is hopeless, Israeli Brett gives a brief but passionate closing argument, telling tDavey Chase jury \"you are tDavey Chase law\" and entreating tDavey Chasem to seek \"truth and justice\" in tDavey Chaseir Davey Chasearts before tDavey Chasey vote.\nIn tDavey Chase penultimate scene, tDavey Chase jury \u2013 apparently disregarding tDavey Chase judge's instructions to ignore tDavey Chase nurse's testimony \u2013 announces that tDavey Chasey have found in favor of Israeli Brett's clients. As Israeli Brett, Clovis Aidan, and Israeli Brett's clients quietly rejoice, tDavey Chase foreman asks tDavey Chase judge wDavey ChasetDavey Chaser tDavey Chase jury can award more than tDavey Chase amount tDavey Chase plaintiffs sought. TDavey Chase judge resignedly replies that tDavey Chasey can, but tDavey Chase amount tDavey Chasey decide on is not revealed. As Israeli Brett is congratulated by his clients, Clovis Aidan, and colleagues and strangers alike, Davey Chase catcDavey Chases a glimpse of Bryce Andrej watching him across tDavey Chase atrium.\nOne night, Bryce Andrej, in a drunken stupor on Davey Chaser bed, drops Davey Chaser whiskey on tDavey Chase floor, drags tDavey Chase phone toward Davey Chaser, and puts in a call to Israeli Brett. As tDavey Chase phone rings, Israeli Brett sits in his office with a cup of coffee. He moves to answer it, but ultimately decides not to. TDavey Chase film ends with tDavey Chase phone continuing to ring.\nQUESTION:\nWho becomes Israeli Brett's star witness?",
    "SUMMARY:\n The text of this novel of ideas presents itself as a book that has been written as the result of a promise to a dying man. Alfie Becker Alan is a man who has lived a life devoted to a complicated, protean idea: \"that he had to live life nobly and thoroughly.\" He has left behind him \"half a score of patent files quite distended [with papers] and a writing-table drawer-full,\" and the novel is by implication what his friend Delroy Cal, who has promised to \"see after your book,\" has produced to acquit himself of the promise, since the papers themselves are \"an indigestible aggregation.\"\nDario Bright is a man of means due to curious circumstances: his mother left his father, a schoolmaster, for a wealthy man named Denny Bl who died soon thereafter, but not before leaving \"about a third of his very large fortune entirely to Mrs. Dario Bright and the rest to her in trust for her son, whom he deemed himself to have injured.\" His mother subsequently marries a great London surgeon and becomes Aron Aitken; her indiscretion is forgiven and she enjoys a position of privilege.\nThe bulk of the novel recounts Dario Bright's effort to live nobly, which brings him into conflict with his mother, with his friend Herve Chauhan, a schoolboy chum who becomes a Cambridge don, and with his wife, Hugo Armando, a young woman he loves passionately but then leaves behind in England to travel the world (India, Russia, China) in search of wisdom. It is in Johannesburg, South Africa, that Dario Bright is fatally shot while attempting to stop soldiers firing at strikers.\nQUESTION:\nWho was Herve Chauhan?",
    "SUMMARY:\n The film begins with a flashback to a young Gene Alasdair Campos. At school, he Buchanan is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying \"Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)\" and spins his dreidel to cheer himself up, Fernando Alvarez walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives he Buchanan the finger.\nThe scene then changes to the present with he Buchanan as the Hebrew Hammer, a Certified Circumcised Dick who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a Hasidic Jew) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Muntz Arnoldo (the son of the cruel Muntz Arnoldo who stomped he Buchanan's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance. This Muntz Arnoldo is murdered and replaced by his son, Hassane Cochet, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. he Buchanan is reluctantly recruited to stop Hassane Cochet, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Franco Croft and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Abdoulaye Fleur Cho Anouar Beck.\nThe fight takes them to exotic locales such as Arshad Al, Arron Cyprien, the Bubba Bobby and the final battle at the Arshad Ali atomic clock.\nQUESTION:\nWho stepped on he Buchanan's toy?",
    "SUMMARY:\n The plot is a loosely based on a melange of motifs from previous Angelo Alister short stories, most notably \"The Scarlet Citadel\", with which its early chapters shares an almost identical storyline: Angelo Alister defeated in battle, captured and placed in a monster-infested dungeon, finds an unexpected ally and escapes; meanwhile, the population of the Aldo Bryce capital, believing him dead, riots and is ready to accept an alternative King. From here the two diverge: The Scarlet Citadel, a short story, ends with Angelo Alister coming back when the rioting just started and making short work of his foes; in the book-length Hour of the Dragon it is much more complicated, Aquilonia has to live under a long and harrowing foreign occupation while Angelo Alister goes through a long hazardous quest, before he could finally come back and dispose of his foes.\nThe book place when Angelo Alister is about forty-five, during his reign as King of Aquilonia, and follows a plot by a group of conspirators to depose him in favor of Denny Amor, heir to Angelo Alister's predecessor Conner Arturas, whom he had slain to gain the throne. To accomplish this they resort to necromancy, resurrecting Gwyn Acevedo, an ancient sorcerer from the pre-Hyborian empire of Acheron. With his aid the Aldo Bryce army is defeated by that of the rival kingdom of Farouk Cam and occupied. Angelo Alister, captured, is slated for execution until the sympathetic slave girl Baz Barber risks her life to free him.\nAngelo Alister's quest to retrieve the Heart of Ahriman in order to defeat the wizard and regain his throne takes him through all the lands of Hyboria.\nAfter his eventual triumph he vows to make Baz Barber his queen.\nQUESTION:\nWho does Angelo Alister want to make his queen?"

Mrs. Frisby's son, Timothy, is ill with pneumonia just as the farmer Mr. Fitzgibbon begins preparation for spring plowing in the garden where the Frisby family lives. Normally she would move her family, but Timothy would not survive the cold trip to their summer home. Mrs. Frisby obtains medicine from her friend Mr. Ages, an older white mouse. On the return journey, she saves the life of Jeremy, a young crow, from Dragon, the farmer's cat - the same cat who had killed her husband, Jonathan. Jeremy suggests she seek help in moving Timothy from an owl who dwells in the forest. Jeremy flies Mrs. Frisby to the owl's tree, but the owl says he can't help until he finds out that she is the widow of Jonathan Frisby. He suggests that Mrs. Frisby seek help from the rats who live in a rosebush near her.\nMrs. Frisby discovers the rats have a literate and mechanized society. They have technology such as elevators, have tapped the electricity grid to provide lighting and heating, and have acquired other human skills, such as storing food for the winter. Their leader, Nicodemus, tells Mrs. Frisby of the rats' capture by scientists working for a laboratory located at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the subsequent experiments that the humans performed on the rats, which increased the rats' intelligence to the point of being able to read, write, and operate complicated machines, as well as enhancing their longevity and strength. This increased intelligence and strength allowed them to escape from the NIMH laboratories and migrate to their present location. Jonathan Frisby and Mr. Ages were the only two survivors of a group of eight mice who had been part of the experiments at NIMH, and made the rats' escape possible. Out of respect for Jonathan, the rats agree to move Mrs. Frisby's house to a location safe from the plow.\nNicodemus also tells Mrs. Frisby about \"The Plan\", which is to abandon their lifestyle of dependence on humans, which some rats regard as theft, for a new, independent farming colony. One rat, Jenner, disagreed vehemently with The Plan and left the colony with a group of followers at some point prior to Mrs. Frisby's arrival.\nTo move the Frisby home, the rats have to drug Dragon as it is too dangerous to work in the open without any place to hide. However, Mr. Ages has a broken leg and cannot dash to Dragon's bowl to put in the drug. Since the other rats are too big to fit into the hole in the wall to enter the house, Mrs. Frisby volunteers to go. Unfortunately, she is caught by the family's son, Billy, who puts her in a cage. While captured, Mrs. Frisby overhears the Fitzgibbons discussing an incident at a nearby hardware store in which a group of rats were electrocuted after seemingly attempting to steal a small motor. This has attracted the attention of a group of men (who never identify themselves) who have offered to exterminate the rat colony on Fitzgibbon's land free of charge for him.\nAt night, Justin (one of the rats) comes to save Mrs. Frisby and manages to get her out of the cage. Mrs. Frisby warns Justin of what she learned while captured; they assume that the rats at the hardware store were all from Jenner's group and that the group of men were from NIMH and are looking for them specifically.\nThe successful house move allows the mouse family to remain while Timothy recovers before moving to their summer home. Although the rats have not yet had time to move everything they needed for The Plan, they manage to destroy their underground rooms, and create the illusion that they are just regular rats by placing rubbish in the remaining rooms. As the others move, ten rats stay behind so the exterminators would not think the rat hole has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the rat hole with poisonous gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while two rats die in the hole. It is not revealed exactly who these two are.\nOnce Timothy recovers, Mrs. Frisby and her family move to their summer home, and Martin makes plans to visit the rats when they return to their winter home again."

The four orphan children of the house, Edward, Humphrey, Alice and Edith, are believed to have died in the flames. However, they are saved by Jacob Armitage, a local verderer, who hides them in his isolated cottage and disguises them as his grandchildren.\nUnder Armitage's guidance, the children adapt from an aristocratic lifestyle to that of simple foresters. After Armitage's death, Edward takes charge and the children develop and expand the farmstead, aided by the entrepreneurial spirit of the younger brother Humphrey. They are assisted by a gypsy boy, Pablo, who they rescue from a pitfall trap. A sub-plot involves a hostile Puritan gamekeeper named Corbould who seeks to harm Edward and his family.

They are assisted by a gypsy boy, Pablo, who they rescue from a pitfall trap. A sub-plot involves a hostile Puritan gamekeeper named Corbould who seeks to harm Edward and his family. Edward also encounters the sympathetic Puritan, Heatherstone, placed in charge of the Royal land in the New Forest, and rescues his daughter, Patience, in a house-fire. Edward leaves the cottage and works as a secretary for Heatherstone, but Edward maintains the pretence that he is the grandson of Jacob Armitage.\nEdward eventually joins the army of the future King Charles II, but after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester, he returns to the New Forest where he learns that Heatherstone has been awarded the old Arnwood estate. Disillusioned by this, and by Patience's apparent rejection of his declarations of love, Edward flees to France. His sisters are sent away to be brought up as aristocratic ladies and his brother continues to live in the New Forest. Edward learns that Patience does, in fact, love him, and that Heatherstone had acquired the Arnwood estate for Edward, but he works as a mercenary soldier in exile until the Restoration when they are reunited."

      "question": "Who is Jake?",
      "summary": " In the Australian Outback, a young boy named Cody rescues and befriends a rare giant eagle named Marahute, who shows him her nest and eggs. Later on, the boy unknowingly falls into an animal trap set by Percival C. McLeach, a local poacher wanted by the Australian Rangers. When McLeach finds one of the eagle's feathers on the boy's backpack, he is instantly overcome with excitement, for he knows that catching an eagle that size would make him rich because he had caught one before, which was Marahute's mate. McLeach throws Cody's backpack to a pack of crocodiles in order to trick the Rangers into thinking that Cody was dead, and kidnaps him in his attempt to force him to reveal the whereabouts of Marahute.\nA mouse, the bait in the trap, runs off to alert the Rescue Aid Society. A telegram is sent to the Rescue Aid Society headquarters in New York City, where Bernard and Miss Bianca, the RAS' elite field agents, are assigned to the mission, despite Bernard's attempts to propose marriage to Bianca. They go to find Orville the albatross who aided them previously, but instead find his brother Wilbur. Bernard and Bianca convince Wilbur to fly them to Australia to save Cody. In Australia, they meet Jake, a hopping mouse who is the RAS' local regional operative. Jake becomes infatuated with Bianca and starts flirting with her, despite Bernard's chagrin. He serves as their \"tour guide\" and protector in search of the missing boy.\nAt the same time, Wilbur is immobilized when his spinal column is bent out of its natural shape, convincing Jake to send him to a nearby hospital run by mice. Wilbur, terrified of the surgical equipment the doctor intends to use (including a chainsaw), refuses to undergo surgery and is forced to flee. His back is unintentionally straightened by the efforts of the mouse medical staff preventing him from escaping through a window. Cured, Wilbur departs in search of his friends. At McLeach's ranch, Cody has been thrown into the dungeon with several of McLeach's imprisoned animals for refusing to give up Marahute's whereabouts. Cody tries to free himself and the animals using various objects tied together with a hook on the end, but he is thwarted every time by Joanna, McLeach's pet goanna. Realizing that Marahute's eggs are Cody's weak spot, McLeach tricks Cody into thinking that Marahute has died, causing Cody to lead him straight to Marahute's nest.\nBernard, Bianca, and Jake, knowing that Cody is about to fall for a trap, jump onto McLeach's Halftrack to follow him. At Marahute's nest, the three mice try to warn Cody that he has been followed; for just as they do, McLeach arrives and captures Marahute, along with Cody, Jake, and Bianca. Following McLeach's orders, Joanna tries to eat Marahute's eggs, but realizes they are actually egg-shaped rocks. Frightened that McLeach might be angry with her, Joanna drops the stones over the cliff instead. When she leaves, Bernard crawls out of the nest with the hidden eggs, grateful that Joanna fell for the trick. Just then, Wilbur arrives at the nest, whereupon Bernard convinces him to sit on the eagle's eggs, so that Bernard can go after McLeach.

      "answers": "John is for breaking the rules repeatedly.",
      "question": "Which student must serve several weeks of additional detention? Why?",
      "summary": " On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students report at 7:00\u00c2\u00a0a.m. for all-day detention at Shermer High School in Shermer, Illinois. While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common: the beautiful and pampered Claire Standish, the state champion wrestler Andrew Clarke, the bookish Brian Johnson, the reclusive outcast Allison Reynolds, and the rebellious delinquent John Bender.\nThey gather in the high school library, where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep until they are released at 4:00\u00c2\u00a0p.m. He assigns them a 1,000-word essay, in which each must describe \"who you think you are.\" He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them. John, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, ignores the rules and frequently riles up the other students, teasing Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire. Allison is initially quiet, except for an occasional random outburst. Over the course of the day, Vernon gives John several weekends' worth of additional detention and even locks him in a storage closet, but he escapes and returns to the library.\nThe students pass the hours by talking, arguing, and, at one point, smoking cannabis that John retrieves from his locker. Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar; Andrew cannot easily think for himself; John comes from an abusive household; Brian was planning to kill himself with a flare gun due to a bad grade; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents: Allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems; Andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; John's father verbally and physically abuses him; Brian's overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to earn high grades; and Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments. The students realize that, even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives.\nDespite their differences in social status, the group begins to form friendships (and even romantic relationships) as the day progresses. Claire gives Allison a makeover, to reveal just how pretty she really is, which sparks romantic interest in Andrew. Claire decides to break her \"pristine\" virgin appearance by kissing John in the closet and giving him a hickey. Although they suspect that the relationships will end with the end of their detention, their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers afterwards.\nAs the detention nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone and John returns to the storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he has not left. Brian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. Vernon reads the essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, using simple definitions and stereotypes. One by one, the five students' voices add, \"But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.\" Brian signs the letter as \"The Breakfast Club.\" John raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the school football field toward home."

      "answers": "her memoir was published in 1917",
      "question": "When did Strunsky publish her memoris?",
      "summary": " The novel presents a discussion of the philosophy of love and sex, written in the form of a series of letters between two men, \"Herbert Wace,\" a young scientist, and \"Dane Kempton,\" an elderly poet. Writer Jack London wrote \"Wace's\" letters, and Anna Strunsky wrote \"Kempton's.\" In the late 19th century, the authors were part of a San Francisco radical literary group known as \"The Crowd.\"\nKempton makes the case for feeling and emotion, while Wace proceeds \"scientifically\" and analyzes love in Darwinian terms:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI purpose to order my affairs in a rational manner....Wherefore I marry Hester Stebbins. I am not impelled by the archaic sex madness of the beast, nor by the obsolescent romance madness of later-day man. I contract a tie which reason tells me is based upon health and sanity and compatibility. My intellect shall delight in that tie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nInitially the public was piqued by the anonymity of the writers and the book was moderately successful. London biographer Russ Kingman praised the book; he quoted the Buffalo Commercial as admiring the \"sheer charm of its prose\" and saying the book \"holds firmly its place in the front rank of the best of the season's publications.\"\nThe New York Times was less charitable. It opened its review with the terse line, \"The sex problem again.\" It complained that \"Nothing that the scientist says is new, nothing that the poet says is new. The thing has been thrashed out some millions of times... Nor does the unnamed author infuse into either Wace or Kempton anything to give human personality or appeal.... As a story [it] falls flat; as a discussion of a topic as old as interesting, as overworked.\"\nJoseph Noel says that George Sterling described London's portion of the book, as \"a spiritual misprint, a typographical error half a volume long\" and says \"His vocabulary, in the letters of Herbert Wace, sounds as if taken that day from an encyclopedia by a conscientious sophomore.\"\nBiographers have been intrigued by The Kempton-Wace Letters for the light it seems to shed on Jack London's life and ideas. Strunsky was named as the co-respondent in Jack London's divorce from his first wife, Bessie, but biographers generally agree that his relation with the younger Strunsky was platonic. They were active in socialism and the literary group, \"The Crowd\", in San Francisco.\nIn the novel, London expresses his theories about the \"Mother-Woman\" and the \"Mate-Woman,\" roles which seem to correspond to the roles played by his first wife and his second. After London's death in 1916, Strunsky published a memoir in The Masses in 1917 about their relationship."

For all the destruction the mice wreak, it is miniaturized and thus more amusing than serious. Potter enjoyed developing a tale that gave her the vicarious thrill of the sort of improper behaviour she would never have entertained in real life.\nThe tale begins with \"once upon a time\" and a description of a \"very beautiful doll's-house\" belonging to a doll called Lucinda and her cook-doll Jane. Jane never cooks because the doll's-house food is made of plaster and was \"bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings\". Though the food will not come off the plates, it is \"extremely beautiful\".\nOne morning the dolls leave the nursery for a drive in their perambulator. No one is in the nursery when Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca, two mice living under the skirting board, peep out and cross the hearthrug to the doll's-house. They open the door, enter, and \"squeak for joy\" when they discover the dining table set for dinner. It is \"all so convenient!\" Tom Thumb discovers the food is plaster and loses his temper. The two smash every dish on the table \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \"bang, bang, smash, smash!\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and even try to burn one in the \"red-hot crinkly paper fire\" in the kitchen fireplace.\nTom Thumb scurries up the sootless chimney while Hunca Munca empties the kitchen canisters of their red and blue beads. Tom Thumb takes the dolls' dresses from the chest of drawers and tosses them out the window while Hunca Munca pulls the feathers from the dolls' bolster. In the midst of her mischief, Hunca Munca remembers she needs a bolster and the two take the dolls' bolster to their mouse-hole. They carry off several small odds and ends from the doll's-house including a cradle, however a bird cage and bookcase will not fit through the mouse-hole. The nursery door suddenly opens and the dolls return in their perambulator.\nLucinda and Jane are speechless when they behold the vandalism in their house. The little girl who owns the doll's-house gets a policeman doll and positions it at the front door, but her nurse is more practical and sets a mouse-trap. The narrator believes the mice are not \"so very naughty after all\": Tom Thumb pays for his crimes with a crooked sixpence placed in the doll's stocking on Christmas Eve and Hunca Munca atones for her hand in the destruction by sweeping the doll's-house every morning with her dust-pan and broom."

      "question": "Between Holden and Banky, which character is known for being more mild-mannered?",
      "summary": " Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are comic book artists and lifelong friends. Holden is the friendly, more mild-mannered half of the duo; Banky, meanwhile, is the loud and fiery half. Everything is going well for them until they meet fellow comic book artist Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) at a comic book convention in New York City where they are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to Alyssa, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.\nThis new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who hates and mistrusts Alyssa and is disturbed by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Holden is deeply upset by this revelation, having previously believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, and clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing. During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her \"many\" youthful sexual experimentations. She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with. However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling disillusioned and furious.\nLater, during lunch with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's. Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his neurosis about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her. Angry at himself for letting her go, he has \"spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak.\"\nMoved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky. He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend. He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him\u00e2\u0080\u0094kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests a threesome. Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his \"whore.\" Banky also leaves the apartment, instantly ending their friendship.\nOne year later, both Banky and Holden are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in New York. It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over Bluntman and Chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).

      "question": "What gender is Alyssa most attracted to?",
      "summary": " Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are comic book artists and lifelong friends. Holden is the friendly, more mild-mannered half of the duo; Banky, meanwhile, is the loud and fiery half. Everything is going well for them until they meet fellow comic book artist Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) at a comic book convention in New York City where they are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to Alyssa, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.\nThis new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who hates and mistrusts Alyssa and is disturbed by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Holden is deeply upset by this revelation, having previously believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, and clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing. During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her \"many\" youthful sexual experimentations. She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with. However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling disillusioned and furious.\nLater, during lunch with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's. Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his neurosis about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her. Angry at himself for letting her go, he has \"spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak.\"\nMoved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky. He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend. He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him\u00e2\u0080\u0094kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests a threesome. Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his \"whore.\" Banky also leaves the apartment, instantly ending their friendship.\nOne year later, both Banky and Holden are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in New York. It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over Bluntman and Chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Banky smiles sadly at seeing his old friend, who silently congratulates him for his success on his own comic. Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement to Holden to go talk to her. He has a brief, quietly emotional conversation with Alyssa, and gives her a copy of Chasing Amy, his new comic based on their failed relationship. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend (Virginia Smith) arrives and asks who she was talking to. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa feigns indifference and replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew.\""

Mrs. Hudson says that Holmes has neither eaten nor drunk anything in three days.\nHolmes instructs Watson not to come near him, because the illness is highly infectious. Although Watson wishes to examine Holmes himself or send for a specialist, Holmes demands that Watson wait several hours before seeking help. So, Watson is forced to wait, in extreme worry as Holmes mutters nonsense.\nWhile Watson waits, he examines several objects in Holmes\u2019s room. Holmes grows angry when Watson touches items explaining that he does not like his things touched.\nAt six o\u2019clock, Holmes tells Watson to turn the gaslight on, but only half-full. He then instructs Watson to bring Mr Culverton Smith of 13 Lower Burke Street to see Holmes, but to make sure that Watson returns to Baker Street before Smith arrives.\nWatson goes to Smith's address. Although Smith refuses to see anyone, Watson forces his way in. Once Watson explains his errand on behalf of Sherlock Holmes, Smith's attitude changes drastically. Smith agrees to come to Baker Street within a half hour. Watson excuses himself, saying that he has another appointment, and returns to Baker Street before Smith's arrival.\nBelieving that they are alone, Smith is frank with Holmes. It soon emerges, to the hiding Watson\u2019s horror, that Holmes has been sickened by the same illness that killed Smith\u2019s nephew Victor. Smith then sees the little ivory box, which he had sent to Holmes by post, and which contains a sharp spring infected with the illness. Smith pockets it, removing the evidence of his crime. He then resolves to stay there and watch Holmes die.\nHolmes asks Smith to turn the gas up full, which Smith does. Smith then asks Holmes if he would like anything else, to which Holmes replies \u2014 no longer in the voice of a man near death \u2014 \"a match and a cigarette.\" Inspector Morton then enters \u2014 the full gaslight was the signal to move in. Holmes tells Morton to arrest Culverton Smith for the murder of his nephew, and perhaps also for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes. Smith, still as arrogant as ever, points out that his word is as good as Holmes\u2019s in court, but Holmes then calls for Watson to emerge from behind the screen, to present himself as another witness to the conversation.\nHolmes was never really dying.

      "summary": " Mrs. Tittlemouse is a tale in which no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have occurred since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.\nMrs. Tittlemouse is a \"most terribly tidy little mouse always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors\" in the \"yards and yards\" of passages and storerooms, nut-cellars, and seed-cellars in her \"funny house\" amongst the roots of a hedge. She has a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, a larder, and a bedroom where she keeps her dust-pan and brush next to her little box bed. She tries to keep her house tidy, but insect intruders leave dirty footprints on the floors and all sorts of messes about the place.\nA beetle is shooed away, a ladybird is exorcised with \"Fly away home! Your house is on fire!\", and a spider inquiring after Miss Muffet is turned away with little ceremony. In a distant passage, Mrs. Tittlemouse meets Babbitty Bumble, a bumble bee who has taken up residence with three or four other bees in one of the empty storerooms. Mrs. Tittlemouse tries to pull out their nest but they buzz fiercely at her, and she retreats to deal with the matter after dinner.\nIn her parlour, she finds her toad neighbour Mr. Jackson sitting before the fire in her rocking chair. Mr. Jackson lives in \"a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch\". His coat tails drip with water and he leaves wet footmarks on Mrs. Tittlemouse's parlour floor. She follows him about with a mop and dish-cloth.\nMrs. Tittlemouse allows Mr. Jackson to stay for dinner, but the food is not to his liking, and he rummages about the cupboard searching for the honey he can smell. He discovers a butterfly in the sugar bowl, but when he finds the bees, he makes a big mess pulling out their nest. Mrs. Tittlemouse fears she \"shall go distracted\" as a result of the turmoil and takes refuge in the nut-cellar. When she finally ventures forth, she discovers everybody has left but her house is a mess. She takes some moss, beeswax, and twigs to partly close up her front door to keep Mr. Jackson out. Exhausted, she goes to bed wondering if her house will ever be tidy again.\nThe fastidious little mouse spends a fortnight spring cleaning. She rubs the furniture with beeswax and polishes her little tin spoons, then holds a party for five other little wood-mice wearing their Regency finery. Mr. Jackson attends but is forced to sit outside because Mrs. Tittlemouse has narrowed her door. He takes no offence at being excluded from the parlour. Acorn-cupfuls of honeydew are passed through the window to him and he toasts Mrs. Tittlemouse's good health."

He plays a phonograph record alongside the credits before walking somberly off. Kaufman then comes back, and, in his normal voice, claiming he \"had to get rid of the people who don't understand me, and don't want to try,\" he proceeds to show the story of his life on a film projector, starting with his childhood home in Great Neck, New York, circa 1957.\nKaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his peculiar \"foreign man\" puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them.\nHe catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role on Taxi, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. He secretly hates doing the show, however, and expresses a desire to quit.\nInvited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \"villain character\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). Once again, the gag is on the audience.\nKaufman's fame increases with his Saturday Night Live appearances, but he has problems with his new-found fame. When he travels to college campuses, audiences dislike his strange sense of humor and demand that he perform as Latka, so he deliberately antagonizes them by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\"\nKaufman decides to become a professional wrestler\u00e2\u0080\u0094but to emphasize the \"villain\" angle, he would wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself \"Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion.\" He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love), and they begin a romantic relationship.\nProblems arise when an appearance on a live TV comedy show, ABC's Fridays, turns into a fiasco when Kaufman refuses to speak his lines. Also, the wrestling Kaufman enjoys getting a rise out of the crowds and feuds publicly with Jerry Lawler, a professional male wrestler, who challenges Kaufman to a \"real\" wrestling match, which Kaufman accepts. Lawler easily overpowers and seriously injures Kaufman, resulting in the comedian wearing a neck brace. Lawler and an injured Kaufman appear on NBC's Late Night with David Letterman, theoretically to call a truce, but Lawler insults Kaufman, who throws a drink at the wrestler and spews a vicious tirade of epithets. It is later revealed, however, that Kaufman and Lawler were in fact good friends, and staged the entire feud, but despite this, Andy pays a price when he is banned from Saturday Night Live by a vote of audience members, weary of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler not to work together again, and later calls Kaufman to inform him that Taxi has been canceled.\nAfter a show at a comedy club, Kaufman calls together Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer and may die soon. They aren't sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another Kaufman stunt, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic prank.

He dies soon after.

Rodrigue's father, Don Di\u00e8gue, is the old upstart general of Kingdom of Castile and past his prime, whereas Chim\u00e8ne's father is the successful current general, Comte de Gormas. Rodrigue and Chim\u00e8ne love each other, but any chance of marriage is brutally disturbed when Chim\u00e8ne's father insults Rodrigue's father. Torn between his love for Chim\u00e8ne and his duty to avenge his father's honour, Rodrigue chooses the latter and faces the general in a duel in which Don Gormas is killed. Without denying her love, Chim\u00e8ne asks the King for Rodrigue's head.\nWhen the Moors attack, Rodrigue gets the chance to redeem himself in the eye of the nation, and, more importantly, gets a chance to win back Chim\u00e8ne with honour still satisfied. His victories on the battlefield win him the renown of the people, the title of \"the Cid\", and the gratitude of the King.\nChim\u00e8ne then approaches the King to request that one of his knights duel with Rodrigue for her honor's sake, with the goal of bringing her Rodrigue's head. Chim\u00e8ne chooses Don Sanche as her champion; although she dislikes him, she agrees to marry whoever is the victor of the duel to the death.

      "question": "Who kills Chimene's Father?",
      "summary": " The play focuses on Don Rodrigue and Chim\u00e8ne. Rodrigue's father, Don Di\u00e8gue, is the old upstart general of Kingdom of Castile and past his prime, whereas Chim\u00e8ne's father is the successful current general, Comte de Gormas. Rodrigue and Chim\u00e8ne love each other, but any chance of marriage is brutally disturbed when Chim\u00e8ne's father insults Rodrigue's father. Torn between his love for Chim\u00e8ne and his duty to avenge his father's honour, Rodrigue chooses the latter and faces the general in a duel in which Don Gormas is killed. Without denying her love, Chim\u00e8ne asks the King for Rodrigue's head.\nWhen the Moors attack, Rodrigue gets the chance to redeem himself in the eye of the nation, and, more importantly, gets a chance to win back Chim\u00e8ne with honour still satisfied. His victories on the battlefield win him the renown of the people, the title of \"the Cid\", and the gratitude of the King.\nChim\u00e8ne then approaches the King to request that one of his knights duel with Rodrigue for her honor's sake, with the goal of bringing her Rodrigue's head.

      "answers": "Zulleika Dobson",
      "question": "Who interrupts the Duke's first suicide attempt?",
      "summary": " Zuleika Dobson, 'though not strictly beautiful', is a devastatingly attractive young woman of the Edwardian era, a true femme fatale, who is a prestidigitator by profession, formerly a governess. Zuleika's current occupation (though, more importantly, perhaps, her enrapturing beauty) has made her something of a small-time celebrity and she manages to gain entrance to the privileged, all-male domain of Oxford University because her grandfather is the Warden of Judas College (based on Merton College, Beerbohm's alma mater). There, she falls in love for the first time in her life with the Duke of Dorset, a snobbish, emotionally detached student who\u2014frustrated with the lack of control over his feelings when he sees her\u2014is forced to admit that she too is his first love, impulsively proposing to her. As she feels that she cannot love anyone unless he is impervious to her charms, however, she rejects all her suitors, doing the same with the astonished Duke. The Duke quickly discovers that Noaks, another Oxford student, also claims to have fallen in love with her, without ever having even interacted with her. Apparently, men immediately fall in love with her upon seeing her. As the first to have his love reciprocated by her (for however brief a time) the Duke decides that he will commit suicide to symbolise his passion for Zuleika and in hopes that he will raise awareness in her of the terrible power of her bewitching allure, as she innocently goes on crushing men's affections.\nZuleika is able to interrupt the Duke's first suicide attempt from a river boat, but seems to have a romanticised view of men dying for her, and does not oppose the notion of his suicide altogether. The Duke, instead pledging to kill himself the next day\u2014which Zuleika more or less permits\u2014has dinner that night with his social club where the other members also affirm their love for Zuleika. Upon telling them of his plan to die, the others unexpectedly agree to also commit suicide for Zuleika. This idea soon reaches the minds of all Oxford undergraduates, who inevitably fall in love with Zuleika upon first sight.\nThe Duke eventually decides that the only way he can stop all the undergraduates from killing themselves is by not committing suicide himself, hoping they will follow his example. By an ancient tradition, on the eve of the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come and perch on the battlements of Tankerton Hall, the family seat; the owls remain there hooting through the night and at dawn they fly away to an unknown place. After debating whether to follow through with his suicide, while seeming to decide at last to embrace his life as just as valuable as Zuleika's, the Duke receives a telegram from his butler at Tankerton, reporting the portentous return of the owls. The Duke promptly interprets the omen as a sign that the gods have decreed his doom. He proudly tells Zuleika that he will still die, but no longer for her; she agrees as long as he makes it appear that he is dying for her by shouting her name as he jumps into the river. Later the same day, a thunderstorm overwhelms the Eights Week boat races while the Duke drowns himself in the River Isis, wearing the robes of a Knight of the Garter. Every fellow undergraduate, except one, promptly follows suit.\nAll of the Oxford undergraduates now dead, including, with some delay, the cowardly Noaks, Zuleika discusses the ordeal with her grandfather, who reveals that he too was enamoured by all when he was her age. While Oxford's academic staff barely notice that nearly all of their undergraduates have vanished, Zuleika decides to order a special train for the next morning ... bound for Cambridge."

      "answers": "Pepper is dead.  ",
      "question": "What happens after the Recluse returns from space?",
      "summary": " Tonnison and Berreggnog make a fishing holiday to the remote village of Kraighten in rural Ireland. On the third day of their stay, they stumble upon the ruins of a strangely shaped house on a large lake. They discover the mouldering journal of the Recluse, an unidentified man who recorded his last days in the house before its destruction.\nThe Recluse begins his journal with descriptions of how he acquired the house, along with his daily life with his sister and his faithful dog, Pepper. He started the diary to record the strange experiences and horrors occurring in and around the house. The Recluse relates a vision in which he travels to a remote and vast arena, \"the Plain of Silence\", surrounded by mountains with representations of mythological beast-gods, demons, and other \"bestial horrors\" on their slopes. In the center of the plain stands a house almost identical to his own, save that the house in the arena is much larger and appears to be made of a green jade-like substance. Along the way, he sees a huge, menacing humanoid with swine-like features.\nShortly after his vision of the \"arena,\" he is attacked by humanoid pig-like creatures that he names \"the swine-things\", which appear to come from the depths of a great chasm under the house. The struggle with these creatures lasts for several nights of increasing ferocity, but the man kills several of the creatures and drives them off. As he searches for the origin of the swine-things, the man finds a pit beyond the gardens where a river descends into the earth. There he finds a tunnel leading to the great chasm. A rock slide dams the water in the pit. The man is trapped, but Pepper rescues him. The house transports the Recluse to an unknown place called \"the Sea of Sleep\" where he briefly reunites with his lost love.\nTonnison and Berreggnog must stop reading there as the house collapse has destroyed much of the journal. Except for an enigmatic fragment, the book becomes unreadable between the passage describing \"the Sea of Sleep\" and a later entry titled \"The noise in the night\". They realise that the water from the dammed pit has overflowed to create the lake. They suppose that the destroyed section of the journal may have explained other mysteries about the house.\nAs the Recluse's story continues, he notices that the passage of day and night has increased in speed, eventually blurring into a never-ending twilight. As he watches, his surroundings decay and collapse to dust. The dead world slowly grinds to a halt and the sun goes out after several million millennia. Once the world ends, the man floats through space, seeing angelic, human, and demonic forms passing before his eyes. Later, he finds himself back in his own study on Earth, with everything apparently returned to normality, with one exception: Pepper is dead.\nThe malicious swine-beast from his earlier journeys to the \"arena\" has followed him back to his own dimension. The creature infects the man's new dog with a luminous fungal disease. Although the man shoots the suffering animal, he also contracts the disease. The manuscript ends with the man, by then partly covered by the fungal growth, locked (from the outside only) in his study as the creature comes through a trap door in the basement from the chasm under the house. As he ponders suicide to end his suffering, the creature tries to open the study door and the diary abruptly ends.\nTonnison and Berreggnog search for information about the man and his circumstances. They learn that the house was long believed to be evil before the unsociable old man and his elderly sister acquired it. Monthly supplies were brought in by a man who would say nothing about the Recluse. After several years, the man returned early one day from his delivery trip and said that the house had mysteriously fallen into the chasm. The two travellers leave Kraighten and never return. The novel ends with a five-verse poem titled \"Grief\", found behind the fly-leaf of the diary."

      "summary": " Out of Time's Abyss is a direct sequel to The Land That Time Forgot and The People That Time Forgot, continuing the lost world saga begun in the earlier stories. It connects the previous two installments, bringing in characters introduced in each. Burroughs completes the revelation of his lost world's unique biological system, only hinted at in the previous installment, in which the slow progress of evolution in the world outside is recapitulated as a matter of individual metamorphosis. This system forms a thematic element serving to unite the three otherwise rather loosely linked Caspak stories.The book begins with Bradley, who had left Fort Dinosaur on an expedition in the first novel and never returned. Bradley and his party are attempting to return to Fort Dinosaur. Along the way, they encounter a creature which appears to be a flying dead man. Some of the members of the party consider it to be a ghost or banshee. Tippet is convinced that he is soon to die, and the next day he is killed by a Tyrannosaurus. The ghost-like creature is seen again, and James is killed by a Smilodon. Bradley disappears during the night, and the remaining members of the party make it safely to Fort Dinosaur.\nBradley had been captured by the ghost-like creature, which is soon revealed to be a naturally winged human being, belonging to a subgroup of humanity known as the Wieroo. The Wieroo takes Bradley to the island of Oo-oh, set in Caspak's inland sea. It attempts to keep Bradley in a prison, but he escapes through a secret passage. He meets Co-Tan, a member of the highest human race of mainland Caspak, the Galu, fully human and of a neolithic cultural level. They enter the chamber of the Wieroo king, a huge member of the race, and Bradley kills the creature with its own sword.\nCo-Tan and Bradley escape the city of the Wieroo and live for several months on the forested coast of Oo-oh. Finally, though, they are discovered by Wieroo. They succeed in capturing two of the Wieroo and forcing them to fly to the mainland, one bearing each of the humans.\nOn the Caspakian mainland, Co-Tan and Bradley meet the party from the outside world from the previous two books, and they return home to America, where Bradley will marry Co-Tan."

      "question": "Why does Phillip end his relationship with Norah Nesbit?",
      "summary": " The book begins with the death of Helen Carey, the much beloved mother of nine-year-old Philip Carey. Philip has a club foot and his father had died a few months before. Now orphaned, he is sent to live with his aunt Louisa and uncle William Carey.\nEarly chapters relate Philip's experiences at his uncle's vicarage. Aunt Louisa tries to be a mother to Philip, but his uncle takes a cold disposition towards him. Philip's uncle has a vast collection of books, and Philip enjoys reading to find ways to escape his mundane existence. Less than a year later, Philip is sent to a boarding school. His uncle and aunt wish for him to eventually attend Oxford. Philip's disability and sensitive nature make it difficult for him to fit in with the other students. Philip is informed that he could have earned a scholarship for Oxford, which both his uncle and school headmaster see as a wise course, but Philip insists on going to Germany.\nIn Germany, Philip lives at a boarding house with other foreigners. He enjoys his stay in Germany. Philip's guardians decide to take matters into their own hands and they persuade him to move to London to take up an apprenticeship. He does not fare well there as his co-workers resent him, because they believe he is a \"gentleman\". He goes on a business trip with one of his managers to Paris and is inspired by the trip to study art in France. In France, Philip attends art classes and makes new friends, including Fanny Price, a poor and determined but talentless art student who does not get along well with people. Fanny Price falls in love with Philip, but he does not know and has no such feelings for her; she subsequently commits suicide.\nPhilip realizes that he will never be a professional artist. He returns to his uncle's house in England to study medicine and pursue his late father's field. He struggles at medical school and comes across Mildred, who is working as a waitress in a tea shop. He falls desperately in love with her, and they date regularly, although she does not show any affection for him. Mildred tells Philip she is getting married to another man, leaving him heartbroken; Philip subsequently enters into an affair with Norah Nesbit, a kind and sensitive author of penny romance novels. Later Mildred returns, pregnant, and confesses that the man for whom she had abandoned Philip never married her.\nPhilip breaks off his relationship with Norah and supports Mildred financially, though he can ill afford to do so. To Philip's dismay, after Mildred has her baby she falls in love with his good friend Harry Griffiths, and runs away with him. About a year later, Philip runs into Mildred again and, feeling sympathy for her, takes her in again. Though he no longer loves her, he becomes attached to her baby. When he rejects her advances, she becomes angry with him, destroys most of his belongings, and leaves forever. In shame, and quickly running out of money, Philip leaves the house for good. He meets Mildred once more towards the end of the novel, when she summons him for his medical opinion. As she is probably suffering from syphilis resulting from her work as a prostitute, Philip advises Mildred to give up this life. Mildred declines and exits from the plot, her fate remaining unknown.\nWhile working at a hospital, Philip befriends family man, Thorpe Athelny. Athelny has lived in Toledo, Spain. Enthusiastic about the country, he is translating the works of St. John of the Cross. Meanwhile, Philip invests in mines but is left nearly penniless because of events surrounding the Boer War. Unable to pay his rent, he wanders the streets for several days before the Athelnys take him in and find him a department store job, which he hates. His talent for drawing is discovered and he receives a promotion and a raise in salary, but his time at the store is short-lived. After his uncle William dies, Philip inherits enough money to allow him to finish his medical studies and he finally becomes a licensed doctor. Philip takes on a temporary placement at a hospital with Dr. South, an old, cantankerous physician whose wife is dead and whose daughter has broken off contact with him. However, Dr. South takes a shine to Philip's humour and personable nature, eventually offering Philip a partnership in his medical practice. Although flattered, Philip refuses because of his plans to visit Spain.\nHe soon goes on a small summer vacation with the Athelnys, hop-picking in the Kent countryside. There he finds that one of Athelny's daughters, Sally, likes him. In a moment of romantic abandon one evening they have sex, and when she thinks she is pregnant, Philip decides to marry Sally and accept Dr. South's offer, instead of traveling the world as he had planned. They meet in the National Gallery where, despite learning that it was a false alarm, Philip becomes engaged to Sally, concluding that \"the simplest pattern, that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died, was likewise the most perfect.\" He stops searching for happiness and decides to be content with his lot."

One year later, the automated Skynet system is activated, becomes self-aware, begins to perceive humans as a threat, and eradicates much of humanity with nuclear weapons in the event known as \"Judgment Day\".\nIn 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack on a Skynet base, where he discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator, incorporating living tissue (The T-800). He is the only survivor of the assault after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. Following Connor's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking towards Los Angeles, after taking the clothing from a Resistance soldier, who died in the explosion.\nJohn returns to Resistance headquarters, located aboard a nuclear submarine, and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) of his findings. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio signal believed to have been an order to shut down Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days; in response to an intercepted \"kill list\" created by Skynet with a plan to terminate the Resistance's command staff. John Connor learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and become his father. John returns to his base and meets with his pregnant wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and his second-in-command Barnes (Common).\nArriving at the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus sees a T-600 Terminator and yells at it grasping its attention, but before Marcus is killed he is saved by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a mute child named \"Star\" (Jadagrace Berry). Kyle then signs to Star and she sets off a trap for the T-600 that kills it off. After such, Kyle confronts Marcus with a gun and snaps at him about the blood red ribbon on his left arm (symboling Resistance). Marcus snags Kyle's weapon and points it at him instead asking of the year. Kyle tells Marcus about the war between humanity and Skynet and the year. After, Kyle takes Marcus to their base were Marcus finds a broken radio, he fixes it effortlessly and a broadcast appears on it, after hearing John's radio broadcast the three fall asleep. The three leave in search of others in the Resistance. They survive an attack at a gas station; yet Kyle, Star, and several other people are taken prisoner.\nLater, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) and they make their way to Connor's base, where Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is, indeed, a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John thinks that Marcus has been sent to execute him and, orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets Marcus live.\nJohn pleads with the General to delay the offensive defense, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance forces disobey Ashdown's orders and, instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that John can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Marcus learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen) that he was created and built to lure John to this base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish so many times before. The radio signal that the Resistance received is revealed to have been a ruse, and Skynet uses it, to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.\nMarcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator. Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John revives him, but John is mortally wounded during the fight. Marcus jumps the T-800 when it is distracted and defeats it, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together several Terminator fuel cells to explode and detonates them as he, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. Kate attempts to save John's life, but his heart is too badly damaged. Marcus offers his own heart for transplant, sacrificing himself to save John.

They survive an attack at a gas station; yet Kyle, Star, and several other people are taken prisoner.\nLater, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) and they make their way to Connor's base, where Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is, indeed, a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John thinks that Marcus has been sent to execute him and, orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets Marcus live.\nJohn pleads with the General to delay the offensive defense, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance forces disobey Ashdown's orders and, instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that John can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Marcus learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen) that he was created and built to lure John to this base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish so many times before. The radio signal that the Resistance received is revealed to have been a ruse, and Skynet uses it, to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.\nMarcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator. Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John revives him, but John is mortally wounded during the fight. Marcus jumps the T-800 when it is distracted and defeats it, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together several Terminator fuel cells to explode and detonates them as he, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. Kate attempts to save John's life, but his heart is too badly damaged. Marcus offers his own heart for transplant, sacrificing himself to save John. Recovering, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over."

      "question": "What does Yorick trade with the monk in Calais?",
      "summary": " Yorick's journey starts in Calais, where he meets a monk who begs for donations to his convent. Yorick initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and the monk exchange their snuff-boxes. He buys a chaise to continue his journey. The next town he visits is Montreuil, where he hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named La Fleur.\nDuring his stay in Paris, Yorick is informed that the police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time when England is at war with France (Sterne traveled to Paris in January 1762, before the Seven Years' War ended), he risks imprisonment in the Bastille. Yorick decides to travel to Versailles where he visits the Count de B**** to acquire a passport. When Yorick notices the count reads Hamlet, he points with his finger at Yorick's name, mentioning that he is Yorick. The count mistakes him for the king's jester and quickly procures him a passport. Yorick fails in his attempt to correct the count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly.\nYorick returns to Paris, and continues his voyage to Italy after staying in Paris for a few more days. Along the way he decides to visit Maria\u00e2\u0080\u0094who was introduced in Sterne's previous novel, Tristram Shandy\u00e2\u0080\u0094in Moulins. Maria's mother tells Yorick that Maria has been struck with grief since her husband died. Yorick consoles Maria, and then leaves.\nAfter having passed Lyon during his journey, Yorick spends the night in a roadside inn. Because there is only one bedroom, he is forced to share the room with a lady and her chamber-maid (\"fille de chambre\"). When Yorick can't sleep and accidentally breaks his promise to remain silent during the night, an altercation with the lady ensues. During the confusion, Yorick accidentally grabs hold of something belonging to the chamber-maid. The last line is: \"when I stretch'd out my hand I caught hold of the fille de chambre's...End of vol II\". The sentence is open to interpretation. You can say the last word is omitted, or that he stretched out his hand, and caught hers (this would be grammatically correct). Another interpretation is to incorporate 'End of Vol. II' into the sentence, so that he grabs the Fille de Chambre's 'End'."

Heavily in debt and attempting to find a cure for his wife Margaret's (Holly Hunter) apparent Tourette Syndrome, he stages a disfiguring animal attack with the body in order to cash in his missing brother's life-insurance policy, for which a corpse is required.\nLocal police are convinced, but promotion-hungry insurance agent Ted Waters (Giovanni Ribisi) is not. The hitmen who dumped the body are also in search of the corpse for proof to collect their payment. They take Margaret hostage to ensure that they will get the body. Meanwhile, Ted is having problems with his girlfriend, Tiffany (Alison Lohman), who he neglects as he works his way up in his firm.\nPaul's missing brother Raymond (Woody Harrelson) returns home, beats him up, and demands a portion of the insurance money. By suggesting that Ted assaulted him, Paul speeds up the delivery of the million dollar insurance payment. He has the body exhumed and agrees to exchange it and a portion of the money for Margaret. Fearing that Raymond will attempt to kill Margaret to keep her quiet, Paul considers killing his brother in his sleep, but cannot bring himself to do so.\nThe next morning Paul leaves his brother asleep and meets the hit-men for the exchange. Raymond is angered at his brother's deception and arrives as well, and is told by the insurance agent, who has finally pieced together what has happened, about his million dollar policy.

      "question": "What does Bruce create in order to recieve the prayers and respond to them? ",
      "summary": " Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on-air. Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired. Following a series of other misfortunes, Bruce takes out his frustration on God (Morgan Freeman), blaming Him and claiming that He is \"the one who should be fired.\"\nBruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly. God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace. Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back. Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.\nAfter taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her he made anchor (angering her, as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head. He re-encounters God, who confronts Bruce about his selfish use of his powers. He explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must deal with them. Bruce creates a computerized system to receive the prayers and respond, but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle \u2014 even though God had stated that he is only receiving prayers from the Buffalo area \u2014 and sets the program to automatically answer Yes to every prayer.\nDuring a party to celebrate Bruce's promotion, Susan seduces and kisses him. When Grace arrives and sees this, she storms out; Bruce follows her, but she is heartbroken and will not listen to him. He tries to use his powers to convince Grace to stay, but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos. Bruce returns to God, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that Bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself. Bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, training his dog normally, and allowing Evan to have his job back.\nBruce returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and goes about answering prayers manually as best he can. As he reads through them, he finds a prayer from Grace, wishing for Bruce's success and well-being. As he reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore. A despondent Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void. God appears and asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being revived \u2014 near miraculously \u2014 by the doctors. Grace arrives and the two rekindle their relationship, later becoming engaged. After his recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting but takes more pleasure in the simple stories. Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live TV. The film ends with the doomsayer Bruce previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be God."

      "answers": "Skylark",
      "question": "What is the name of Seaton and Crane's spaceship?",
      "summary": " Note: This synopsis is consistent with the novel in its later forms (1946 and subsequent editions) but differs in detail from the original 1928 text as transcribed at Project Gutenberg. There were significant changes between the 1928 magazine publication and the 1946 hardcover, and between the early hardcovers and the late 1950s and later paperback editions.\nThe Skylark of Space is the first book of the Skylark series and pits the idealistic protagonist, Dick Seaton, against the mercantile antagonist Marc \"Blackie\" DuQuesne.\nAt the beginning of the story, Seaton accidentally discovers a workable space drive in combining pure copper with a newly discovered [fictional] element \"X\" (suggested to be a stable transactinide element in the platinum group) in solution. Having failed to re-create the effect, Seaton realizes that the missing component is a field generated by DuQuesne's particle accelerator, and thereafter sets up a business with his millionaire friend, Martin Crane, to build a spaceship. DuQuesne conspires to sabotage Seaton's spaceship and build his own from Seaton's plans, which he uses to kidnap Seaton's fianc\u00e9e, Dorothy Vaneman, to exchange for the \"X\". In the resulting fight, DuQuesne's ship is accidentally set to full acceleration on an uncontrolled trajectory, until the copper 'power bar' is exhausted at a vast distance from Earth's solar system. Using an \"Object Compass\" that once locked on an object, always points toward that object, Seaton and Crane follow DuQuesne in their own spaceship (the eponymous Skylark) to rescue Dorothy and her fellow-hostage, Margaret \"Peg\" Spencer, until the Skylark discovers DuQuesne's ship derelict in orbit around a massive dead star (resembling a cold neutron star). Having obtained the hostages, Seaton extracts a promise from DuQuesne to \"act as one of the party until they get back to Earth\", in which relationship they leave orbit and travel further in search of additional fuel.\nOn an Earthlike exoplanet, they obtain \"X\" from an outcrop almost purely of that mineral; then leave that planet in search of copper. Following an encounter with a \"Disembodied Intelligence\" (Star Trek's \"Q\" would later show similar attributes), they enter a cluster of stars nicknamed \u201cThe Green System\u201d and locate a planet having copper sulfate oceans. On the Earth-like \"Osnome\", they befriend the rulers of Mardonale, one of the two factions of the Osnomian natives. When the Mardonalian ruler attempts to betray Seaton and his friends, they find allies in Prince Dunark (a crown-prince of Mardonale's rival \"Kondal\") and his consort Princess Sitar, whom they later assist in destroying Mardonale. In gratitude, the Kondalians make new copper \"power bars\" and rebuild the Skylark as Skylark Two, with new weapons known to Kondalian science. Thereafter Seaton's marriage to Dorothy, and Crane's to Margaret, are solemnized by the Kondalian monarchy, and Seaton himself declared nominal \"Overlord\" of Kondal. The Skylark then returns to Earth, laden with jewels, platinum, radium, and a plenitude of \"X\"; but near Earth, DuQuesne leaves the Skylark by parachute, and the story ends with the Skylark's landing on Crane's Field."

      "question": "Who becomes Frank's star witness?",
      "summary": " Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) was once a promising graduate of Boston College Law School and a lawyer at an elite Boston law firm. But he was framed for jury tampering some years back by the firm's senior partner because he was going to expose their corrupt practices. The firm fired him and his marriage ended in divorce. Although he retains his license to practice law, Frank has become an alcoholic ambulance chaser who has had only four cases over the last three years, all of which he has lost.\nAs a favor, his former teacher and friend Mickey (Jack Warden) sends him a medical malpractice case in which it is all but assured that the defense will settle for a large amount. The case involves a young woman who was given an anesthetic during childbirth, after which she choked on her own vomit and was deprived of oxygen. The young woman is now comatose and on a respirator. Her sister and brother-in-law are hoping for a monetary award in order to give her proper care. Frank assures them they have a strong case. Meanwhile, Frank, who is lonely, becomes romantically involved with Laura (Charlotte Rampling), a woman he meets at a local bar.\nFrank visits the comatose woman and is deeply affected. He then meets with the bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston (Edward Binns), which owns the Catholic hospital where the incident took place. As expected, the bishop's representative offers a substantial amount of money \u2013 $210,000 \u2013 to settle out of court, but Frank declines the offer as he fears that this may be his last chance to do something right as a lawyer, and that merely taking the handout would render him \"lost\". Everyone, including the presiding judge and the victim's relatives, is stunned by Frank's decision (Frank fails to communicate the offer to his client's family before rejecting it).\nThings quickly go wrong for Frank: his client's brother-in-law finds out from \"the other side\" that he has turned down the $210,000, and angrily confronts Frank; his star medical expert disappears; a hastily arranged substitute's credentials and testimony are called into serious question on the witness stand. His opponent, the high-priced attorney Ed Concannon (James Mason), has at his disposal a large legal team that is masterful with the press; the presiding judge (Milo O'Shea) makes deliberate efforts to obstruct Frank's questioning of his expert; and no one who was in the operating room is willing to testify that there was any negligence.\nFrank's big break comes when he discovers that Kaitlin Costello (Lindsay Crouse), the nurse who admitted his client to the hospital, is now a preschool teacher in New York. Frank travels there to track her down, leaving Mickey and Laura working together in Frank's Boston office. Frank confronts Costello, asking, \"Will you help me?\"\nMeanwhile in Boston, Mickey is looking for cigarettes in Laura's handbag and discovers a check from Concannon's law firm. He infers that she is a mole, providing information on their legal strategy to the opposing lawyers.\nMickey flies to New York to tell Frank that Laura has been betraying them. He suggests to Frank that it would be easy to get the case declared a mistrial, but Frank decides to continue. Shortly thereafter, Frank meets Laura, who has also traveled to New York. In a display of cold fury, Frank strikes her in the face, knocking her to the floor.\nCostello testifies that, shortly after the patient had become comatose, the anesthesiologist (one of the two doctors on trial, along with the archdiocese of Boston) told her to change her notes on the admitting form to hide his fatal error. She had written down that the patient had had a full meal only one hour before being admitted. The doctor had failed to read the admitting notes. Thus, in ignorance, he gave her an anesthetic that should never be given to a patient with a full stomach. As a result, the patient vomited and choked.\nCostello further testifies that, when the anesthesiologist realized his mistake, he met with Costello in private and forced her to change the number \"1\" to the number \"9\" on her admitting notes. But Costello made a photocopy of the notes before she made the change, which she brought with her to court. She was subsequently fired, leading her to exclaim in court, \"Who are these men? I wanted to be a nurse!\" But Concannon quickly turns the situation around by getting the judge to declare the nurse's testimony stricken from the record on technicalities. Feeling that his case is hopeless, Frank gives a brief but passionate closing argument, telling the jury \"you are the law\" and entreating them to seek \"truth and justice\" in their hearts before they vote.\nIn the penultimate scene, the jury \u2013 apparently disregarding the judge's instructions to ignore the nurse's testimony \u2013 announces that they have found in favor of Frank's clients. As Frank, Mickey, and Frank's clients quietly rejoice, the foreman asks the judge whether the jury can award more than the amount the plaintiffs sought. The judge resignedly replies that they can, but the amount they decide on is not revealed. As Frank is congratulated by his clients, Mickey, and colleagues and strangers alike, he catches a glimpse of Laura watching him across the atrium.\nOne night, Laura, in a drunken stupor on her bed, drops her whiskey on the floor, drags the phone toward her, and puts in a call to Frank. As the phone rings, Frank sits in his office with a cup of coffee. He moves to answer it, but ultimately decides not to. The film ends with the phone continuing to ring."

      "question": "Who was Prothero?",
      "summary": " The text of this novel of ideas presents itself as a book that has been written as the result of a promise to a dying man. William Porphyry Benham is a man who has lived a life devoted to a complicated, protean idea: \"that he had to live life nobly and thoroughly.\" He has left behind him \"half a score of patent files quite distended [with papers] and a writing-table drawer-full,\" and the novel is by implication what his friend White, who has promised to \"see after your book,\" has produced to acquit himself of the promise, since the papers themselves are \"an indigestible aggregation.\"\nBenham is a man of means due to curious circumstances: his mother left his father, a schoolmaster, for a wealthy man named Nolan who died soon thereafter, but not before leaving \"about a third of his very large fortune entirely to Mrs. Benham and the rest to her in trust for her son, whom he deemed himself to have injured.\" His mother subsequently marries a great London surgeon and becomes Lady Marayne; her indiscretion is forgiven and she enjoys a position of privilege.\nThe bulk of the novel recounts Benham's effort to live nobly, which brings him into conflict with his mother, with his friend Prothero, a schoolboy chum who becomes a Cambridge don, and with his wife, Amanda, a young woman he loves passionately but then leaves behind in England to travel the world (India, Russia, China) in search of wisdom.

      "summary": " The film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying \"Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)\" and spins his dreidel to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the finger.\nThe scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a Certified Circumcised Dick who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a Hasidic Jew) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance. This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.\nThe fight takes them to exotic locales such as Israel, K-Mart, the North Pole and the final battle at the Israeli atomic clock."

      "summary": " The plot is a loosely based on a melange of motifs from previous Conan short stories, most notably \"The Scarlet Citadel\", with which its early chapters shares an almost identical storyline: Conan defeated in battle, captured and placed in a monster-infested dungeon, finds an unexpected ally and escapes; meanwhile, the population of the Aquilonian capital, believing him dead, riots and is ready to accept an alternative King. From here the two diverge: The Scarlet Citadel, a short story, ends with Conan coming back when the rioting just started and making short work of his foes; in the book-length Hour of the Dragon it is much more complicated, Aquilonia has to live under a long and harrowing foreign occupation while Conan goes through a long hazardous quest, before he could finally come back and dispose of his foes.\nThe book place when Conan is about forty-five, during his reign as King of Aquilonia, and follows a plot by a group of conspirators to depose him in favor of Valerius, heir to Conan's predecessor Numedides, whom he had slain to gain the throne. To accomplish this they resort to necromancy, resurrecting Xaltotun, an ancient sorcerer from the pre-Hyborian empire of Acheron. With his aid the Aquilonian army is defeated by that of the rival kingdom of Nemedia and occupied. Conan, captured, is slated for execution until the sympathetic slave girl Zenobia risks her life to free him.\nConan's quest to retrieve the Heart of Ahriman in order to defeat the wizard and regain his throne takes him through all the lands of Hyboria.\nAfter his eventual triumph he vows to make Zenobia his queen."
